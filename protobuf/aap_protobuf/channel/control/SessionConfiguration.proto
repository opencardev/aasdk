/**
 * @file SessionConfiguration.proto
 * @brief Capability flags for Android Auto session configuration.
 *
 * SessionConfiguration enumerates optional features and UI display modes that
 * the head unit can request from the Android device. These flags are sent during
 * protocol handshake to configure the session based on display hardware and
 * desired user interface presentation.
 *
 * UI visibility flags: Bits 1-4 control which status indicators are shown.
 *   - UI_CONFIG_HIDE_CLOCK: Hide system clock from status bar
 *   - UI_CONFIG_HIDE_PHONE_SIGNAL: Hide cellular signal strength indicator
 *   - UI_CONFIG_HIDE_BATTERY_LEVEL: Hide device battery percentage
 *
 * Example scenario: Automotive head unit with integrated dashboard:
 *   - T+0ms: Head unit supports integrated clock display, cell signal, battery
 *   - T+0ms: SessionConfiguration sent with no HIDE flags (all 0)
 *   - T+0ms: Android device shows time, signal, battery in AA UI
 *   - User sees unified clock in dashboard + redundant AA clock = confusing
 *   - Better: SessionConfiguration with UI_CONFIG_HIDE_CLOCK (1)
 *   - Android hides its clock, head unit displays integrated version
 *
 * Media capabilities:
 *   - CAN_PLAY_NATIVE_MEDIA_DURING_VR: Device can play car-native audio while
 *     VR (virtual reality) / 360-degree video content plays on Android (rare)
